                <p>
                    The Ministry of Employment and Labor of South Korea administers the EPS-TOPIK Test (also known as KLT) to choose foreign laborers to work in Korean manufacturing facilities, construction sites, farms, etc. To ensure that prospective foreign employees can carry out their responsibilities in Korea effectively and can live their daily lives without experiencing any language barriers, it tests their language abilities. They compile a list of qualified international job applicants based on their EPS-TOPIK score so that they can apply for positions and obtain the appropriate working visas (E-9).
